# Pagerank
Write a function called pagerank to calculate the PageRank of all nodes of a graph.  Input:  G - Networkx Directed Graph Object max_iter - Number of Iterations (should have some default value) d - damping parameter (should have some default value) has_weight - boolean to be set if using a weighted graph (should have some default value) Output: A dict where key is a node and values is the pagerank value  Note:  The function should Create Transiston Matrix, A Create initial vector, v0 Write update equation, Av0 = v1 Write convergence condition, number of iterations or no change in page rank values Iteratively update the PageRank values until convergence condition has been reached Make sure you add checks for things that may not make your algorithm to run (e.g., Graph is empty). If for some reason PageRank cannot be executed, it should fail elegantly
